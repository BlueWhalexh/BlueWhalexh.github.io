After I finished my primary school education, my parents rewarded me with my first mobile phone, which allowed me to access social media. At that time, I mainly used WeChat and QQ to chat and share my life with friends and family.\nDo you think you spend too much time on social media?\nYes, I do spend a lot of time on social media. I often chat with friends on WeChat and browse videos on Douyin. The design of these platforms makes it easy to get hooked, and sometimes I even spend an entire day on them, especially during holidays.\nWhat do people do on social media?\nI think most people use social media to share snippets of their lives, such as outings and gatherings. Additionally, people enjoy watching short videos, reading interesting news, or exploring topics they are passionate about, like pets, games, and celebrities. Social media has also become an important channel for acquiring information and learning new things.\nDo your friends use social media?\nAbsolutely, in recent years, people have become inseparable from social media. At university, some teachers even post assignments and course notifications on social media. My friends and I use WeChat to communicate, and I can say that without social media, life would become very inconvenient.\nSunglasses # Do you often wear sunglasses?\nTo be honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t even own a pair of sunglasses. The only time I wore sunglasses was last month during a trip to Beijing. I borrowed a pair from a friend because I thought wearing sunglasses would make me look cooler in photos.\nDo you spend a lot of money on sunglasses?\nNo, I haven\u0026rsquo;t spent any money on sunglasses. Even though I could buy a pair at a reasonable price, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel the need to because I rarely use them. Also, I find wearing sunglasses a bit uncomfortable.\nDo you give sunglasses as a gift?\nActually, I haven\u0026rsquo;t. I usually don\u0026rsquo;t consider sunglasses as a gift because choosing the right pair involves considering comfort and style, and a poorly chosen pair might not satisfy the recipient. I prefer to choose other types of gifts.\nWhy do you wear sunglasses?\nThe only time I wore sunglasses was during my trip to Beijing. The sun was extremely bright at noon, and I encountered a beautiful scenery. Without sunglasses, I could barely keep my eyes open, so I borrowed a pair from my friend.\nHave you ever lost your sunglasses?\nNo, I haven\u0026rsquo;t, because the only time I wore sunglasses was when I borrowed my friend\u0026rsquo;s pair. Knowing that I was borrowing them, I was extra careful to protect them and avoid losing or damaging them.\nCakes # Do you like eating cakes or other sweet food?\nYes, I love eating sweets, especially ice cream and cream puffs. Every time I eat desserts, I feel very happy. During hot weather, having an ice cream is particularly enjoyable and helps me beat the heat.\nAre there any traditional Chinese cakes?\nYes, in my hometown, there\u0026rsquo;s a very classic and famous traditional cake called pineapple cake. Almost everyone who visits there buys some to taste. It has a pineapple filling and a great texture, making it very popular among tourists.\nDid you like to eat cakes as a child?\nOf course, almost all children love sweets, especially cakes. Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to eat cakes very often when I was young, every time I did, it made me extremely happy. It was a special treat.\nCan you make cakes?\nNo, I can\u0026rsquo;t make cakes. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m not good at cooking in general. I haven\u0026rsquo;t specifically learned these skills because I\u0026rsquo;m not really interested in cooking.\nDo you like to have some desserts after meals/for dinner?\nYes, after finishing my studies for the day, I have dinner. Sometimes, I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s not enough, so I go to the store to buy some desserts. This makes me feel happy and more satisfied.\nColors # What is your favorite color?\nMy favorite color is sky blue. Although I can\u0026rsquo;t explain exactly why, whenever I see the sky or something in sky blue, I feel very relaxed and peaceful.\nDo you usually wear clothes in your favorite color?\nSometimes, but more often, I prefer wearing solid-colored clothes like white and black because they look simpler. I think this matches my aesthetic better.\nAre there any colors that have a special meaning in your country?\nYes, definitely. Red is a color with special significance in China. For example, the national flag is red. Red symbolizes good luck, joy, and prosperity. It is used extensively in important festivals and occasions for decoration.\n","date":"June 4, 2024","permalink":"/posts/94b3067/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Listening"},{"content":"Social Media\nFrom when did you start using social media?\nI started using social media when I was 12 years old.

Others argue that it is better to try and improve such situations. #Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. #Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. #14-1-1 #Recently, many people have been discussing whether it is necessary to accept an unfavorable situation, such as a poor work environment or insufficient compensation. While some believe that it is best to endure these conditions for the sake of stability, others argue that it is better to strive for improvement. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my own opinion.\n*To begin with, accepting a less favorable environment can contribute to a more stable life. In today\u0026rsquo;s challenging job market, finding a truly satisfactory job can be difficult. Opting to seek better employment may entail the risk of unemployment, which negatively impacts one\u0026rsquo;s standard of living. Additionally, jobs with lower salaries often come with shorter working hours and less stress, allowing individuals to enjoy more leisure time and thus enhancing their overall happiness. For example, a friend of mine chose to stay in a lower-paying job because it allowed her to spend more time with her family, ultimately leading to a more balanced and fulfilling life.\nConversely, pursuing a better job can have significant benefits for one\u0026rsquo;s physical and mental health. A good working environment typically involves less physical labor, reducing the risk of work-related injuries. Moreover, with higher earnings, individuals have greater financial resources to address health issues. Furthermore, engaging in a job that one enjoys can lead to greater job satisfaction, prevent boredom, and improve daily mood, ultimately contributing to long-term well-being. For instance, another acquaintance of mine switched to a job that aligned with his passions. Although the transition was challenging, he now enjoys better mental health and greater career satisfaction.\nIn summary, while there are risks associated with seeking a more satisfactory job, such as potential unemployment, I believe that in the long run, striving for a fulfilling career can lead to a more secure and happier life. The benefits of improved health, greater job satisfaction, and financial stability outweigh the temporary challenges one might face during the transition. Therefore, it is worth the effort to pursue better job opportunities and not settle for less favorable situations.\n","date":"June 4, 2024","permalink":"/posts/first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Some people believe that it is best to accept a bad situation, such as an unsatisfactory job or shortage of money.","title":"Writing"},{"content":"Some people believe that it is best to accept a bad situation, such as an unsatisfactory job or shortage of money.
